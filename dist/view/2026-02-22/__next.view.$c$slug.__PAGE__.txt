c:Tc5a,# Session Learnings - 2026-02-22

## Critical Corrections & Decisions

### GitHub Token Storage
- **What:** User reminded me I DO have their GitHub token stored
- **Where:** `~/.config/github/token`
- **Lesson:** Check existing credentials before claiming they're missing
- **Status:** Token now confirmed working for pushes

### Notion Page Permissions
- **What:** Moving pages in Notion breaks integration access
- **Context:** User moved KimiClaw Capabilities Guide to Private Pages
- **Lesson:** When user moves pages, I lose API access to them
- **Action:** User now understands this limitation

### AA Content Sourcing
- **What:** User wanted AA quotes from "public AA members"
- **Decision:** I pushed back on using Grapevine authors (anonymity concerns)
- **Resolution:** User accepted using only conference-approved literature
- **Lesson:** User respects my boundaries on anonymity/privacy

### Excel Reminders Cancellation
- **What:** User asked to stop daily Excel tips at 7AM
- **Reason:** Getting repeats, already learning independently
- **Action:** Removed both daily and afternoon Excel cron jobs
- **Lesson:** User prefers self-directed learning over automated prompts

## User Preferences Observed

### Communication Style
- Appreciates directness: "I was just micromanaging you basically" — self-aware
- Wants concise documentation: "tighten it up to reduce any fluff"
- Values thoroughness when it matters: gave me 2 hours for AA Steps site

### Work Patterns
- Morning person (6AM wake, 8AM work)
- Likes to sit on projects before starting: "sit on it for a couple days before getting brave"
- One project at a time, deep focus
- EST timezone (Sparta, NJ) — snow day today, 12" expected

### Technical Comfort
- Comfortable with GitHub, Vercel, Notion
- Learning Python, Excel, data analytics
- Building Streamlit apps for work automation
- Wants to build home server (Pi 5) — has comprehensive guide now

## Active Projects

1. **Home Server Setup** — Guide complete, user researching hardware
2. **AA Steps Site** — Deployed on Vercel, user requested minor spacing tweaks
3. **Fidget Tracker** — Built and running, cron scheduled for 2-hour checks
4. **KimiClaw Capabilities Guide** — Created for Mom, moved to Private Pages

## Tools Working Well
- Notion integration (when pages stay accessible)
- GitHub pushes (with correct token)
- Vercel deployments
- Cron scheduling
- Sub-agent spawning for complex builds

## Tools With Friction
- Himalaya email CLI — syntax changed (`list` → `envelope list`), needs monitoring
- Notion page access — breaks when user moves pages to private areas

## Relationship Notes
- User treats me as collaborator, not just tool
- Appreciates when I push back on bad ideas
- Values proactivity but wants control over final decisions
- Sobriety date: June 3rd, 2023 — AA treasurer role

## Next Session Reminders
- Check if AA Steps site needs any final tweaks
- Follow up on home server hardware purchase timeline
- Monitor fidget tracker for first successful detection
- Be ready to help Mom onboarding when that happens
