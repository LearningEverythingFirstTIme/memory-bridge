# 2026-02-27 - Session Log

## The Silence Bureau - MAJOR MILESTONE

**The Silence Bureau interactive fiction platform is now LIVE!**
- Deployed to: https://cyoa.vercel.app
- Repository: https://github.com/LearningEverythingFirstTIme/CYOA
- 92 story nodes, 5 branches, 8 endings
- Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Blade Runner aesthetic with branch-specific atmospheres

**Key technical achievements:**
- Separated hooks from components (useTypewriter vs ParagraphTypewriter)
- Fixed tailwind.config.ts format (must be TypeScript, not CSS)
- Resolved CSS build issues on Vercel
- Full story engine with GameContext state management

**Nick's intent:** "I want to do a LOT of work on this app" - treat as ongoing priority

## Shiny Hunter App Updates

**EV Integration Complete:**
- Added EV (Effort Value) data for all 364 Pokémon
- Data sourced from Game8: https://game8.co/games/Pokemon-Legends-Z-A/archives/559836
- EVs display next to Pokémon name: "Pokémon Name (+1 Attack)"
- Updated HuntCard.svelte and PokemonCard.svelte

**Hunt Methods Simplified:**
- Changed to: Random Encounter, Fast Travel, Bench Reset only
- Removed: Mass Outbreak, Alpha Hunt, Dex Research, Roaming

**Mobile UX Improved:**
- Moved -1 button to right side (away from +1)
- Made +1 full-width primary button
- Better spacing to prevent misclicks

## Git Workflow Lesson

When pushing subdirectory projects to new GitHub repos:
1. Check if .git exists in project directory
2. If not, run `git init` to create fresh repo
3. Then add remote and push

This was the issue with silence-bureau - it was being tracked by parent workspace repo.

## Active Projects Status

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Silence Bureau | LIVE | Priority project, Nick wants to do lots of work |
| Shiny Hunter | Updated | EV data added, UX improved, 364 Pokémon |
| Memory Bridge | Stable | Working well |

## Next Session Priorities

1. The Silence Bureau enhancements (Nick wants to do "a LOT of work")
2. Monitor for any deployment issues
3. Potential new projects


## EV Display Debugging (7:51 AM)

**Issue:** EVs not showing in Shiny Hunter app despite code being correct.

**Investigation:**
- EV data exists in ev-data.ts for all 364 Pokémon
- POKEMON array has evs: EV_DATA['Name'] references
- HuntCard.svelte has lookup: `$: pokemon = POKEMON.find(p => p.name === hunt.pokemonName)`
- EV display code is present in both HuntCard and PokemonCard

**Potential causes:**
1. Pokemon lookup failing (name mismatch between hunt and POKEMON array)
2. Hunt created before EV data was added
3. Case sensitivity issue
4. Build not reflecting latest changes

**Action taken:** Changed EV display color to pink for visibility debugging.
