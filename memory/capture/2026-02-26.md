- [23:27] [note] AGENTS.md in root workspace is outdated compared to memory-bridge version

## Technical Details
- Source of truth: memory-bridge/memory/ has complete history
- Root workspace/memory/ was nearly empty (only empty 2026-02-26.md)
- Health check script located at: memory-bridge/scripts/memory-health-check.py
- Reports saved to: /root/.openclaw/workspace/reports/

## Open Loops
- Consider syncing AGENTS.md from memory-bridge to root workspace
- Consider setting up automatic sync between root and memory-bridge

## Mood
Methodical, systematic fix execution
