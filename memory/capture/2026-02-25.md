# Session Capture — 2026-02-25

## Summary
Discussed memory system enforcement mechanisms and the gap between documented protocols and actual execution. Identified that user vigilance is currently the only enforcement.

## WAL Entries
- [17:16] [decision] Trigger phrase locked: "perform your memory ritual" = full retrospective
- [17:20] [friction] No automatic enforcement mechanism exists — I could skip the ritual
- [17:25] [decision] User vigilance is current enforcement method
- [17:30] [idea] Better system: auto-detect phrase, mandatory execution, verify file write
- [17:35] [open-loop] Need to actually execute the ritual when triggered

## Technical Details
- Working Buffer age: 7.4 hours (fresh)
- Flush script ran but found no WAL entries to extract
- Manual capture required because buffer wasn't being updated during session

## Open Questions
- How to implement automatic trigger detection?
- How to verify file writes actually happened?
- How to make ritual mandatory before responding?
