# Evening Journal — 2026-02-25

## Decisions
- Nick requested memory system audit
- Prioritized Phase 1-2 improvements (capture format + role clarity)
- Manually capturing session now to preserve context

## Friction Points
- Discovered tonight's session wasn't captured — Working Buffer wasn't flushed

## Wins
- Completed full audit of memory architecture
- Identified 5 issues with severity ratings
- Updated AGENTS.md with session-end capture template
- Clarified Working Buffer as session-local, ephemeral
- Clarified SESSION-STATE as persistent, durable
- Updated MEMORY-QUICKREF.md with role distinctions
- Cleaned SESSION-STATE.md of session-local content
- Refreshed Working Buffer template
- Tested evening journal parser with new format — works correctly
- Added compaction recovery trigger to AGENTS.md
