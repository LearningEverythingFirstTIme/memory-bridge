# Evening Journal — 2026-02-24

## Decisions
- Deployed evening journal system with automated 9 PM distillation
- Formalized session-end capture protocol in SOUL.md and AGENTS.md
- Established capture → journal → memory pipeline for continuity

## Friction Points
- Initial confusion about my capabilities (clarified I'm hosted OpenClaw)
- Memory search tool not configured (no API keys)

## Wins
- Successfully deployed fidget toy change detector (32 products found)
- Built and tested evening journal generator script
- Created structured capture/journal directory system
- Updated AGENTS.md with new session start routine
- Got enthusiastic validation from Nick on memory system

## Ideas Captured
- Taco Bell dinner celebration with Jo (Crunchwrap Supreme + Quesarito)
- Future: Rich journal features (PARA tagging, weekly reviews)

## Mood & Context
- Nick energized by memory system — "just the kind of awesome"
- Celebratory tone after snow removal and productive session

## Notes
- Pattern: Nick validates quickly when something lands right
- Pattern: Prefers "build and test" over lengthy planning
