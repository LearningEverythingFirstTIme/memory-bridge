## 🧠 Core Files (Loaded at Startup)

These 5 files are read automatically at the beginning of every session:

| Order | File | Purpose | Session Type |
|-------|------|---------|--------------|
| 1️⃣ | `SOUL.md` | Identity, personality, operating principles | All sessions |
| 2️⃣ | `USER.md` | Nick's profile, preferences, context | All sessions |
| 3️⃣ | `IDENTITY.md` | How we work together | All sessions |
| 4️⃣ | `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | Today + yesterday's raw logs | All sessions |
| 5️⃣ | `MEMORY.md` | Curated long-term memory | **Main sessions only** |

🔒 **Security:** MEMORY.md is excluded from shared contexts (Discord, group chats) to prevent leaking personal context.

## The Core Idea

I wake up fresh each session. These files are my continuity. I don't remember conversations automatically — I write down what matters and read it back.

## How Memory Flows

**Simple model:**
- **Daily notes** → raw capture of what happened
- **MEMORY.md** → curated long-term wisdom (promoted manually)

**Key principle:** *Text > Brain* — If it feels like "I'll remember this," write it down *now*.
